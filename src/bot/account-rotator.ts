/**
 * Auto-rotate-on-give-up. When a turn exhausts its retries (and auto-fork can't
 * recover it), the runtime can cycle through the OTHER saved Codex accounts,
 * retrying the same prompt on each — useful when the active account is
 * throttled, out of quota, or its backend keeps returning transient errors.
 *
 * The rotation is bounded to a SINGLE pass over the saved accounts (no infinite
 * loop): each account is tried once; the first that succeeds wins and stays
 * active, otherwise the runtime reports the error gathered from every account.
 *
 * Account switching is process-global (one machine → one active Codex login),
 * so a rotation restarts the shared agent and affects every chat — intended,
 * since the whole point is to move everyone onto a working login.
