/**
 * Session forking helpers — "logical fork" of a Codex session.
 *
 * A fork is a fresh session in the same project, *primed* with the recent
 * transcript of the session it continues, so the conversation survives when the
 * original can't be used: its exclusive lock is held by another window, or it
 * got throttled / exhausted / stuck mid-turn. Used by:
 *   • lost-session recovery (a persisted session we can't reload), and
 *   • auto-fork-on-error (a transient prompt failure with no streamed output).
